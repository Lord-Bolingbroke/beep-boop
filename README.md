## Behavioral Specifications
* Program replaces numbers containing 0 with "Beep!":
  * Expect input(20) to return ("Beep!")
* Program replaces numbers containing 1 with "Boop!":
  * Expect input(71) to return ("Boop!")
* Program replaces numbers divisible 3 with "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that.":
  * Expect input(9) to return ("I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that.")
* Program applies the above rules in increasing order of priorityâ€”numbers that contain both 0 and 1 are replaced with "Boop!"; numbers that both contain one and are divisible by three are replaced with "I'm sorry, Dave. ...":
  * Expect input(12) to return ("I'm sorry, Dave. ...")
  * Expect input(10) to return ("Boop!")
  * Expect input(90) to return ("I'm sorry, Dave. ...")
* Program returns the range of integers between 0 and the user input using the above rules:
  * Expect input(5) to return ("Beep!", "Boop!", 2, "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that.", 4, 5)
